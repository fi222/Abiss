# Abiss
File system that hide information
hello, first of all I am not a programmer, I'm new to github and dont know how to use github, I just have an idea and want to share,
so here is my idea:
its built with levels of files first level 50 files or more looks like the keyboard every letter and number has a file and symbol if needed
lets say I press the file "a" under that again I see the same 50 files lets say my "password" is "abiss" I press "a" then "b" the "i" 
then "s" then "s" there i can drag and drop the info I want
every level is times 50, first level has 50 files, the second level has 2500 files third level has 125,000 files fourth level has 6,250,000 files 
the fifth level  312,500,000 the sixths level 15,625,000,000 files seveth 781,250,000,000 and so on "abiss" will be on the fifth level with 312,000,000 files
so if you dont have the "key" it very hard to go look for something
now every file is divided to "password"side and non password side if I start with "a" and use a password I do that when I create a trail to put a info or file 
down below so password 123 and press "a" file second level password abc press "b" file and so on i can choose password yes or no on the way down.  now "a" file with a password is not the same as "a" with a password that makes it even harder to find anything, it split the file 
thats the idea in general, it's basiclly one file that is duplicated to fifty and again and so on. not sure if you can do it in windows or linux if there is room in windows/linux computer for all these files or do it on external ssd with few terabytes..
the Idea is that if someone try's to look for your info/files you've hidden it takes a long long time to look for it, and time cost money, 
so that it, I have no idea what to do from here is anybody got idea's I want it to be open source free to use, please give me feedback on in if you can  
Thanks fi222
